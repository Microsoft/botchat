# Code

This project is based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The completed code contains multiple files. You can start by reading [`App.js`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/19.customization-plain-ui/src/App.js).

## Goals of this bot

This project has two goals:

- Using Web Chat without using any of its UI component
- Build your own highly-customized UI with minimal functionalities
   - Support suggested actions
   - Support `imBack`, `messageBack`, and `postBack`
   - Support rendering hyperlinks

Although UI is main part of Web Chat, the state machine and business logic in Web Chat core is very valuable for building your highly-customized chat UI.
