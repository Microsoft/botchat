# Customizing Web Chat with a plain HTML UI

This sample shows how to use Web Chat without its canned UI component.

When we designed Web Chat, we heavily considered the importance of customization. To make customization great and accessible, we designed our components in layers. Developers can get the full experience of Web Chat by:

1. using all of our layers as-is,
2. building their own UI from the ground up using Web Chat's business logic, or
3. opting into our UI but replacing just a handful of components as needed.

Below is the explanation of different layers of Web Chat.

                  <ul>
                     <li>Due to its stateless nature, for example, it does not understood suggested actions, because suggested actions depends on previous state</li>

            HOC function to support components by exposing all Web Chat UI API as props. The <code>connectToWebChat</code> method is very similar to Redux <code>connect</code> function, and provides access to all of the data required to build a chat component.

         <td>
            HOC function to hoist specific features from Web Chat as props to the connected component. Although this is very similar to <code>connectToWebChat</code>, it provides encapsulation of information and the business logic only required for the specific component type.

# Things to try out

-  Type `image` in the send box
   -  It should show an image
-  Type `suggested-actions` in the send box
   -  `imBack`, `messageBack`, and `postBack` buttons should work as expected
-  Type `card bingsports` in the send box
   -  Unsupported attachment will be rendered as preformatted JSON

# Code

This project is based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The completed code contains multiple files. You can start by reading [`App.js`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/19.customization-plain-ui/src/App.js), which replaces the default Web Chat renderer with [`<PlainWebChat>`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/19.customization-plain-ui/src/PlainWebChat.js) and uses its own UI.

## Goals of this bot

This project has two goals:

-  Use Web Chat without using any of its UI components
-  Build your own highly-customized UI with minimal functionalities
   -  Support suggested actions
   -  Support `imBack`, `messageBack`, and `postBack`
   -  Support rendering hyperlinks

Although the UI is the main part of Web Chat, the state machine and business logic in Web Chat Core is very valuable for building your own highly-customized chat UI.
