# Sample - Using hybrid speech engine

A simple web page which use separate speech engines for speech-to-text and text-to-speech. This sample makes changes that are based off of the [Cognitive Services Speech Services sample](./../06.c.cognitive-services-speech-services-js/README.md).

# Test out the hosted sample

- [Try out MockBot](https://microsoft.github.io/BotFramework-WebChat/06.f.hybrid-speech)

# How to run locally

- Fork this repository
- Navigate to `/Your-Local-WebChat/samples/06.f.hybrid-speech` in command line
- Run `npx serve`
- Browse to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

# Things to try out

- Use the microphone button: you should be able to provide commands to the bot via speech
- Speak `help`: you should see a full list of MockBot features
- Speak `card weather`: you should see a weather card built using Adaptive Cards
- Speak `carousel`: you should see a carousel of cards

# Code

> Jump to [completed code](#completed-code) to see the end-result `index.html`.

### Goals of this bot

The `index.html` page has one main goal:

- To enable speech by using different engines:
   - Speech-to-text: browser-supported speech engine
   - Text-to-speech: Cognitive Services Speech Services engine

We will start by using the [Cognitive Services Speech Services sample](./../06.c.cognitive-services-speech-services-js/README.md) as our Web Chat template.

> Web browser speech package is available in the Web Chat core bundle and the full bundle, and you can use either CDN in your bot.

[TBD]
