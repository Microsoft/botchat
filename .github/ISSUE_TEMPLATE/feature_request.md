## User story

I want to add auto complete to the send box.

<!-- Please attach sketches with annotations, if any -->

Our users are mostly on mobile devices. Typing on a mobile device is not as attractive as tapping on buttons.

## Alternatives

I have tried suggested actions but it does not fit in the user story because:

- They are not dynamic
- Only 5 of them is shown

## Other implementations

App ABC and XYZ implemented this feature. In app ABC, they show the auto-completes using inlined text. In app XYZ, they show the auto-completes on top of the input box.

<!-- Please attach screenshots, if any -->

## Potential implementation

<!-- If you would implement this feature, please let us know how it should be done -->

While the user is typing, we should send partial text to the bot. And the bot would suggest in real time.
