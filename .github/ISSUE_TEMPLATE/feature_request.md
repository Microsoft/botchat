## User story

Today, auto complete is not implemented in the send box.

Tomorrow, I want to add auto complete to the send box. Our users are mostly on mobile devices. Tapping buttons than typing make the chatbot experience more attractive.

<!-- Please attach sketches with annotations, if any -->

## Alternatives

I have tried suggested actions but it does not fit in the user story because:

- They are not dynamic
- Only 5 of them is shown

## Other implementations

App ABC and XYZ implemented this feature. In app ABC, they show the auto-completes using inlined text. In app XYZ, they show the auto-completes on top of the input box.

<!-- Please attach screenshots, if any -->

## Potential implementation

<!-- If you would implement this feature, please let us know how it should be done -->

While the user is typing, we could send partial text to the bot via `typing` activity. And the bot would suggest in real time using suggested actions.
