# Feedyou fork of Microsoft Bot Framework WebChat

Embeddable web chat control for the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://www.botframework.com) using the [DirectLine](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/directline3/) API. This repo is customized fork of [BotBuilder-WebChat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat) by [Feedyou](https://feedyou.agency). This features were added in comparsion with `BotBuilder-WebChat`:
  * show typing indicator on startup until the first message is recieved
  * increase typing indicator timeout from 3 to 20 seconds
  * show `imBack` buttons only for the last activity
  * send backchannel event on startup which could be used instead of `conversationUpdate` event
  * ability to pass some `userData` to bot using backchannel mechanism's `channelData` prop
  * preset some default values in `<App>` component - for example generate `user.id` if not set
  * support custom button click trigger for restarting conversation (`startOverTrigger` prop)
  * make emoticons compatible using [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) 
  * configurable style themes (currently only `theme.mainColor` prop)
  * auto show upload button when `inputHint` property of last incoming activity was `expectingUpload`

## How to add Web Chat to your website

### What you will get from Feedyou
These are configuration values you will get from Feedyou during WebChat implemenation phase.

  * `DirectLine secret` is used for authentication
  * `Bot ID` is string in format `feedbot-*`
  * `Bot name` will be shown as author name of messages from bot

Please paste these values to places marked by `...` in examples.

### In your non-React website

Include `botchat.css` and `botchat-es5.js` (from our https://feedyou.blob.core.windows.net/webchat/latest CDN) in your website, choose ID of element where webchat should be placed and paste required values you got from Feedyou. 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="https://feedyou.blob.core.windows.net/webchat/latest/botchat.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="bot" />
    <script src="https://feedyou.blob.core.windows.net/webchat/latest/botchat-es5.js"></script>
    <script>
      // we want unique ID for every customer
      var makeid = function () {
        var text = "";
        var possible = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
        for (var i = 0; i < 11; i++)
          text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));
        return text;
      };

      BotChat.App({
        directLine: { secret: '...' },                  
        user: { id: makeid(), name: 'User' },    // you can change user name by yourself
        bot: { id: 'feedbot-...', name: '...' },
        showUploadButton: false,
        resize: 'detect',    
        locale: 'cs',
      }, document.getElementById("bot"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> We no longer package polyfills in `botchat.js`. If you are no on an older browser, you can use the smaller bundle `botchat.js`, which do not include polyfills for browsers which support up to ES5.

You can see expandable WebChat example including customized styling in [/samples/feedyou/expandable.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/expandable.html). Note that `BotChat` component is initialized only after chat window is expanded, so bot is not triggered for users who not open chat.

For the most simple way how to implement WebChat into your website for exmaple using GTM, see [/samples/feedyou/code.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/code.html).

<!---
* `/samples/standalone` has a slightly more sophisticated version of this code, great for testing
* You can reference to latest release like this, [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/botchat.js). Make sure you use the same version for both `botchat.css` and `botchat.js`.
   * You can also reference to a previously published build, for example, [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.11.4/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.11.4/botchat.js).
   * Or if you want to try out latest fixes as on our GitHub `master` branch, you can use [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.13.1-master.ea2166a/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.13.1-master.ea2166a/botchat.js). For all version information, you can find it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botframework-webchat?activeTab=versions).
* Don't want to depend on a CDN? Download the files and serve them up from your own website.
* Want to run a custom build of Web Chat? Clone this repo, [alter it](#customizing-web-chat), [build it](#building-web-chat), and reference your built `botchat.css` and `botchat.js` files.
* Go to the next level with [Advanced Web Chat](#advanced-web-chat)
* Running Web Chat inline may not work for some web pages. Read on for a solution.

### In your React website

The simplest approach is to clone this already customized fork, [build it](#building-web-chat), then reference your local build in your project's `package.json` as follows:

```javascript
dependencies: {
    ...
    'botframework-webchat': 'file:/path/to/your/repo'
    ...
}
```

Running `npm install` will copy your local repo to `node_modules`, and `import`/`require` references to `'botframework-webchat'` will resolve correctly.

Include the `Chat` component in your React app, e.g.:

```typescript
import { Chat } from 'botframework-webchat';

...

const YourApp = () => {
    <div>
        <YourComponent />
        <Chat directLine={{ secret: '...' }} user={{ id: '...', name: 'User' }} bot={{ id: 'feedbot-...', name: 'Bot name' }} />
        <YourOtherComponent />
    </div>
}

...
```

## Building Web Chat

1. Clone (or fork) this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` (to build on every change `npm run watch`, to build production `npm run prepublish`)

This builds the following:

* `/built/*.js` compiled from the TypeScript sources in `/src/*.js` - `/built/BotChat.js` is the root
* `/built/*.d.ts` declarations for TypeScript users - `/built/BotChat.d.ts` is the root
* `/built/*.js.map` sourcemaps for easier debugging
* `/botchat.js` webpacked UMD file containing all dependencies (React, Redux, RxJS, etc.)
* `/botchat.css` base stylesheet
* `/botchat-es5.js` is the Webpack bundle (a.k.a. `botchat.js`) plus polyfills for ES5 browsers
* `/botchat-fullwindow.css` media query stylesheet for a full-window experience

## Customizing Web Chat

### Styling

In the `/src/scss/` folder you will find the source files for generating `/botchat.css`. Run `npm run build-css` to compile once you've made your changes. For basic branding, change `colors.scss` to match your color scheme. For advanced styling, change `botchat.scss`.

#### Card Sizes / Responsiveness

Web Chat strives to use responsive design when possible. As part of this, Web Chat cards come in 3 sizes: narrow (216px), normal (320px) and wide (416px). In a full-window chat, these sizes are invoked by a CSS media query in the `/botchat-fullwindow.css` style sheet. You may customize this style sheet for the media query breakpoints in your own application. Or, if your Web Chat implementation is not a full-window experience, you can manually invoke card sizes by adding the CSS classes `wc-narrow` and `wc-wide` to the HTML element containing your chat.

### Strings

You can alter or add localized strings in [/src/Strings.ts](src/Strings.ts):

* Add one or more locales (with associated localized strings) to `localizedStrings`
* Add logic to map the requested locale to the supported locale in `strings`
* Please help the community by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/pulls).

### Behaviors

Behavioral customization will require changing the TypeScript files in `/src`. A full description of the architecture of Web Chat is beyond the scope of this document, but here are a few starters:

### Architecture

* `Chat` is the top-level React component
* `App` creates a React application consists solely of `Chat`
* `Chat` largely follows the Redux architecture laid out in [this video series](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree)
* To handle async side effects of Redux actions, `Chat` uses `Epic` from [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org) - here's a [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF5-V-Szo0c)
* Underlying `redux-observable` (and also [DirectLineJS](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-directlinejs)) is the `RxJS` library, which implements the Observable pattern for wrangling async. A minimal grasp of `RxJS` is key to understanding Web Chat's plumbing.

### The Backchannel

Web Chat can either create its own instance of DirectLine (as shown in `/samples/standalone`), or it can share one with the hosting page (as shown in `/samples/backchannel`). In the shared case, Web Chat and/or the page can send and/or receive activities. If they are type 'event', Web Chat will not display them. This is how the backchannel works.

NOTE: The provided backchannel sample requires a bot which can send and receive specific event activities. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ryanvolum/backChannelBot) to deploy such a bot.

The backchannel sample provided in this project listens for events of name "changeBackground" and sends events of name "buttonClicked". This highlights the ability for a bot to communicate with the page that embeds Web Chat.

In the sample above, the web page creates a DirectLine object:

```typescript
var botConnection = new BotChat.DirectLine(...);
```

It shares this when creating the Web Chat instance:

```typescript
BotChat.App({
    botConnection: botConnection,
    user: user
    ...
}, document.getElementById("BotChatGoesHere"));
```

It notifies the bot upon the click of a button on the web page:

```typescript
const postButtonMessage = () => {
    botConnection
        .postActivity({ type: "event", value: "", from: { id: "me" }, name: "buttonClicked" })
        .subscribe(id => console.log("success"));
    }
```

Note the creation of an activity of type 'event' and how it is sent with `postActivity`. Also note that the name and value of the event can be anything defined by the developer. It is simply a contract between the web page and the bot.

The client JavaScript also listens for a specific event from the bot:

```typescript
botConnection.activity$
    .filter(activity => activity.type === "event" && activity.name === "changeBackground")
    .subscribe(activity => changeBackgroundColor(activity.value))
```

The bot, in this example, can request the page to change the background color via a specific event with `name: 'changeBackground'`. The web page can respond to this in any way it wants, including ignoring it. In this case it cooperates by changing the background color as passed in the `value` field of the event.

Essentially the backchannel allows client and server to exchange any data needed, from requesting the client's time zone to reading a GPS location or what the user is doing on a web page. The bot can even "guide" the user by automatically filling out parts of a form and so on. The backchannel closes the gap between client JavaScript and bots.
