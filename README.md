# Feedyou fork of Microsoft Bot Framework WebChat

Embeddable web chat control for the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://www.botframework.com) using the [DirectLine](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/directline3/) API. This repo is customized fork of [BotBuilder-WebChat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat) by [Feedyou](https://feedyou.agency). This features were added in comparsion with `BotBuilder-WebChat`:
  * show typing indicator on startup until the first message is recieved
  * increase typing indicator timeout from 3 to 20 seconds
  * show `imBack` buttons only for the last activity
  * send backchannel event on startup which could be used instead of `conversationUpdate` event
  * ability to pass some `userData` to bot using backchannel mechanism's `channelData` prop
  * preset some default values in `<App>` component - for example generate `user.id` if not set
  * support custom button click trigger for restarting conversation (`startOverTrigger` prop)
  * make emoticons compatible using [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) 
  * configurable style themes (currently only `theme.mainColor` prop)
  * auto show upload button when `inputHint` property of last incoming activity was `expectingUpload`

## How to add Web Chat to your website

### What you will get from Feedyou
These are configuration values you will get from Feedyou during WebChat implemenation phase.

  * `DirectLine secret` is used for authentication
  * `Bot ID` is string in format `feedbot-*`
  * `Bot name` will be shown as author name of messages from bot

Please paste these values to places marked by `...` in examples.

### What you will need to do on your website

Include `botchat.css` and `botchat-es5.js` (from our https://feedyou.blob.core.windows.net/webchat/latest CDN) in your website, choose ID of element where webchat should be placed and paste required values you got from Feedyou. 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link href="https://feedyou.blob.core.windows.net/webchat/latest/botchat.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="bot" />
    <script src="https://feedyou.blob.core.windows.net/webchat/latest/botchat-es5.js"></script>
    <script>
      BotChat.App({
        directLine: { secret: '...' },                  
        bot: { id: 'feedbot-...', name: '...' }
      }, document.getElementById("bot"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> If you don't want to use polyfills for older browsers, you can use `botchat.js` instead of default `botchat-es5.js`.

You can see expandable WebChat example including customized styling in [/samples/feedyou/expandable.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/expandable.html). Note that `BotChat` component is initialized only after chat window is expanded, so bot is not triggered for users who not open chat.

For the most simple way how to implement WebChat into your website for exmaple using GTM, see [/samples/feedyou/code.html](https://github.com/wearefeedyou/feedbot-webchat/blob/master/samples/feedyou/code.html).

<!---
* `/samples/standalone` has a slightly more sophisticated version of this code, great for testing
* You can reference to latest release like this, [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/botchat.js). Make sure you use the same version for both `botchat.css` and `botchat.js`.
   * You can also reference to a previously published build, for example, [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.11.4/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.11.4/botchat.js).
   * Or if you want to try out latest fixes as on our GitHub `master` branch, you can use [https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.13.1-master.ea2166a/botchat.js](https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/0.13.1-master.ea2166a/botchat.js). For all version information, you can find it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botframework-webchat?activeTab=versions).
* Don't want to depend on a CDN? Download the files and serve them up from your own website.
* Want to run a custom build of Web Chat? Clone this repo, [alter it](#customizing-web-chat), [build it](#building-web-chat), and reference your built `botchat.css` and `botchat.js` files.
* Go to the next level with [Advanced Web Chat](#advanced-web-chat)
* Running Web Chat inline may not work for some web pages. Read on for a solution.
