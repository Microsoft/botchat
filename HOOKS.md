# Web Chat API as React hooks

Web Chat is designed to be highly customizable. In order to build your own UI, you can use React Hooks to hook your UI component into Web Chat API.

To enable Web Chat API, all UI components must be located under the [`<Composer>`](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/master/packages/component/src/Composer.js) component. You can refer to our [plain UI customization](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/21.customization-plain-ui) sample for details.

## Properties

All properties follow [React State Hook pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html). For example, if you want to get and set the value of send box, you will use the following code:

```js
const [sendBoxValue, setSendBoxValue] = useSendBoxValue();

console.log(`The send box value is "${ sendBoxValue }".`);

setSendBoxValue('Hello, World!');
```

Some properties may not be settable and exception will be thrown if called.

```

`children` is a list of React elements that represent attachments. They should be rendered as part of the activity.

```

## `useAvatarForBot`

```js
useAvatarForBot(): [{

The content of the file must be represented in URL. If you are uploading an `Blob`/`File`, you can use [`URL.createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL) function to create a temporary URL.

If you are using `ArrayBuffer`, you can use `FileReader` to convert it into a blob before calling [`URL.createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL).

The suggested actions is computed from the last message activity sent from the bot. If the user posted an activity, the suggested actions will be cleared.

## `useTimeoutForSend`

```js
useTimeoutForSend(): [number]
```

This function will return the interval before a sending activity is considered fail. The interval is represented in milliseconds. Due to network partitioning problem, activity that failed to send could eventually successfully deliver to the bot.
