# Web Chat API as React hooks

Web Chat is designed to be highly customizable. In order to build your own UI, you can use React Hooks to hook your UI component into Web Chat API.

To enable Web Chat API, all UI components must be located under the [`<Composer>`](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/master/packages/component/src/Composer.js) component. You can refer to our [plain UI customization](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/21.customization-plain-ui) sample for details.

## Why React Hooks

React Hooks will make your code cleaner and shorter, and also greatly improve readability.

Web Chat expose our APIs through React Hooks. This API surface enables us to freely move stuff behind the scene, introduce new APIs, and a safe way to deprecate APIs. It will also make us easier to shuffle work between our internal Redux store and React Context.

## Two types of hooks

We design our hooks largely with two basic shapes:

- Actions, these are functions that you can call at any time to perform a side-effect
- Properties, these are getter function with an optional setter
   - This is same as [React State Hook pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), but setter could be optional
   - If the value changed, React will call your render function again

### Actions

All actions will return a function that you can call later. For example, if you want to focus to the send box, you will use the following code:

```js
const focusSendBox = useFocusSendBox();

focusSendBox();
```

### Properties

All properties follow [React State Hook pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html). For example, if you want to get and set the value of send box, you will use the following code:

```js
const [sendBoxValue, setSendBoxValue] = useSendBoxValue();

console.log(`The send box value is "${ sendBoxValue }".`);

setSendBoxValue('Hello, World!');
```

> Note: some properties may not be settable.

The suggested actions is computed from the last message activity sent from the bot. If the user posted an activity, the suggested actions will be cleared.

## `useTimeoutForSend`

```js
useTimeoutForSend(): [number]
```

This function will return the interval before a sending activity is considered fail. The interval is represented in milliseconds. Due to network partitioning problem, activity that failed to send could eventually successfully deliver to the bot.

- Convert [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) into object URL
- Generate thumbnail and will use Web Worker and offscreen canvas if supported
